# OTDM â€“ Lab 02

This lab focuses on the implementation of the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** in **AMPL**, exploring both its **primal** and **dual quadratic formulations**.

---

## Overview

Support Vector Machines are powerful supervised learning models used for classification. They can be formulated as **quadratic optimization problems**:

- **Primal formulation**: Direct optimization over the separating hyperplane parameters with margin maximization and slack variables for soft margins.  
- **Dual formulation**: Optimization expressed in terms of Lagrange multipliers, allowing the use of kernel functions and efficient solutions for high-dimensional data.

In this lab, both formulations are implemented in **AMPL**, providing hands-on experience with mathematical programming techniques for machine learning.
